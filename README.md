# 0. BueStats
Advanced statistics have proven to be a crucial tool for basketball coaches in order to improve training skills. Indeed, the performance of the team can be further optimized by studying the behaviour of players under certain conditions, thus NBA teams already created highly skilled data science departments to handle tons of information, such as tracking data or the output of other advanced computer vision algorithms. However, European teams are far behind in this field, and tracking data is completely otherworldly for the 97% of them, but the worst thing is that there is not an existing culture-data tradition, which creates the need for data. Coaches have a solid point when they say that their job includes not only practice preparation, but also video sessions, individual meetings, or even physical and conditioning stuff, so they have basically no time to start digging for data for a rough analysis a posteriori. 
The goal of BueStats is fulfilling these couple of gaps:
1. Provide coaches with a basic tool that automatically extracts advanced-statistics reports. 
2. Help coaches handle data in order to create a habit. Reports' data will not have complex information, but game conditioning factors and metrics that are easy to understand (tutorials are coming soon!), as it is important to establish a solid numerical basis before moving forward. 

In particular, at the moment, BueStats can provide advanced statistics reports of FEB teams (Spanish Basketball Federation), which include any team/player from: 
**Liga Femenina Endesa** (1st female Spanish division)
**Leb Oro** (2nd male Spanish division)
**Liga Femenina 2** (2nd female Spanish division)
**Leb Plata** (3rd male Spanish division)
**Liga EBA** (4th male Spanish division)
